                            I've been coding since the age of 9 when I wrote my first JavaScript program â€” a Samsung 
                            Galaxy S4 clone.
                            Intrigued by the boundless possibilities of code, I pursued an 
                            Artificial Intelligence course in high school, where I built games like Othello
                            and Connect 4 and their solvers, and utilized tools like Pomegranate for neural networks and 
                            Pillow for image analysis. Venturing into the realm of image-based AI, I 
                            later explored Computer Vision. 

                            I've also undertaken several internships over the past few years. In the field of 
                            Systems Biology, I developed algorithms to simulate calcium ion concentrations
                            for Alzheimer's Detection. Within the telecommunications realm, I developed a 
                            new service center with full-stack development.
                            
                            Forever a builder, I continuously expand my technological toolkit
                            to kickstart more projects and build impactful innovations.

                            coding, you can find me singing to Adele, gushing over the latest

                            with Guy Raz are my favorites), or solving expert-level Sudoku puzzles.
