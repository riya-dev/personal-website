                I've been coding since the age of 9 when I wrote my first
                JavaScript program â€” a Samsung Galaxy S4 clone. Intrigued by the
                boundless possibilities of code, I pursued an Artificial
                Intelligence course in high school, where I built games like
                Othello and Connect 4 and their solvers, and utilized tools like
                Pomegranate for neural networks and Pillow for image analysis.
                Venturing into the realm of image-based AI, I later explored
                Computer Vision. I've also undertaken several internships over
                the past few years. Forever a builder, I continuously expand my
                technological toolkit to kickstart more projects and build
                impactful innovations.

                When I'm not coding, you can find me singing to Adele, gushing
                over the latest fashion shows, listening to my favorite podcasts
                (Morning Brew Daily and How I Built This are my favorites), or
                trading in the markets.
