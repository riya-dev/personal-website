                            I've been coding since the age of 9 when I wrote my first JavaScript program â€” a Samsung 
                            Galaxy S4 clone.
                            Intrigued by the boundless possibilities of code, I pursued an advanced 
                            Artificial Intelligence course in high school, where I built Othello, Connect 4, 
                            and Sudoku game solvers, utilizing tools like Pomegranate for neural networks and 
                            Pillow for image analysis.

                            Venturing into the realm of image-based AI, I later explored Computer Vision, developing 
                            algorithms for Coin Detection/Identification, 3D Platonic Solid Rotation, Smallest Squares, 
                            and Canny Edge Detection. 

                            I've also undertaken several internships over the past few years, exploring 
                            diverse industries. In the field of Systems Biology within academia, I developed 
                            a simulation for Alzheimer's Detection based on calcium ion concentrations (Java,
                            Python, MATLAB, Anaconda, and FORTRAN). Within the 
                            telecommunications realm, I used Appian, MySQL, and MariaDB for the full-stack
                            development of a new service center.
                            
                            Forever a builder, I continuously expand my technological toolkit
                            to kickstart more projects and build impactful innovations.

                            coding, you can find me singing to Adele, gushing over the latest  
                            fashion shows, listening to my favorite podcasts (Crime Junkies and How I Built This 
                            with Guy Raz are my favorites), or solving expert-level Sudoku puzzles.
